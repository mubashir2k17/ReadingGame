# ReadingGame
a react app for kids to learn how to read.

basic idea:
the app will show a word. User will have to speak it. If correct we will reward the user and also speak the word using voice synthesizer.

If the student reads the word incorrectly then we will give 2 more tries. After the user has completely failed we will speak the word using voice synthesizer.

the word list will be in the code.

the score will be saved using local storage.

additional feature:
1) show rewards using custom stickers
2) show images from google search, this will help in understanding what the word means.
